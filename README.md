# BoggleTestScala

Production: ![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/esebesta/BoggleTestScala.svg?branch=production)   Master: ![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/fpinscala/fpinscala.svg?branch=master)

This repository serves as a scala and github exercise. I've used it to implement a simple Scala algorithm related to solving a boggle board, and to examine how git and github (and travis-ci) can be used for development. 

TODO:

1. Add scalastyle support.
2. Auto-generate scaladocs.
3. Consider doing some ScalaCheck property based testing.
